# FPGA-camera-simulator-ECE 412/413 capstone project 
This is the capstone project for FPGA camera simulator, 
This project involves the design of a PCB that will interface to Sightline’s 3000 & 4000 series products
and simulate a camera input entirely in FPGA. The PSU students will be responsible for designing the
interface board and, if progress allows, programming the FPGA to simulate a camera. The PCB requires
no enclosure (mechanical design) and has a pre-determined form factor

our team was tasked with 3 “phases” of deliverables:  
1. Build the PCB and verify integrity. (Power, connectivity, etc.)  
2. Set up development tools and program the FPGA to simulate a camera.  
3. Process the image/video through SightLine’s VideoTrack software as if it were a real camera.  

While our team was unable to fully complete the initial two phases that we had set out to finish, both phase 1 and phase 2 are at approximately 95% completion, with only the board needing to be manufactured and the code needing to be uploaded to the board to test with the 3000/4000 OEM products.  

For the programming part, our team decided to use color pattern simulate to instead of PCB board test
